# StupidlySimple-TaskList
A stupidly simple task list to keep you productive and focused.

There is really nothing to it. This is a terminal-based script that allows you to create tasks, mark them as done and not done, then saves them to a local database.

This project was created to get a little more experience with SQL and SQLite, I've also found myself using products like Notion to keep track of things and I tend to put way too much time into making those things look pretty and nice to look at rather than working on my actual tasks.
